# PitchBuddy
PitchBuddy is an AI football match recommendation system that helps you decide what matches to watch when the schedule is packed with a lot of fixtures.

PitchBuddy considers the following factors when deciding what games are interesting:
- The scoring potential of the team
- The style of play and coaching tactics of the team
- The historical context of the match
- What stakes involved
- The caliber of players in each team (star players)
